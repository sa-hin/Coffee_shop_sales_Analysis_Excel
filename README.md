## :arrow_right:Project Introduction
This project analyzes sales data from a coffee shop, providing insights into transaction trends, product performance, and customer preferences. The analysis includes detailed breakdowns by time, location, and product categories, helping to identify patterns and opportunities for business improvement. 

## :arrow_right:Dataset Overview
Maven Roasters, a coffee shop chain with three branches in New York City, aims to enhance its understanding of customer purchasing behavior and optimize operational efficiency. The objective is to analyze coffee shop data to identify trends, patterns, and provide actionable recommendations for improvement. It has detailed records of each sale, including transaction ID, date, time, quantity, store location, product details, and total bill amount.

## Key features
:black_circle:__Time Analysis__: Breakdown of sales by hours, days, and months to identify peak sales periods.

:black_circle:__Product Performance__: Analysis of different product categories, including coffee, tea, bakery items, and more.

:black_circle:__Store Comparison__: Comparison of sales performance across different store locations.

:black_circle:__Customer Preferences__: Insights into popular product types, sizes, and special categories like sustainably grown products.

## Project Structure

__Transactions__: Raw transaction data for individual sales.

__Pivot Tables__: Precomputed summaries for quick reference and analysis.

__Dashboard__: Visual tools and charts to aid in data interpretation.

__Excel__: The primary tool for data storage, analysis, and visualization.

__Pivot Tables__: For summarizing and aggregating data to provide insights.

__Charts and Graphs__: For visual representation of data trends and patterns. 

## Functions and Formulas used:

### 1.Pivot Tables:

- __[Data Summarization](https://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)__-  Pivot tables summarize data by aggregating totals, averages, counts, and other statistics.

- __[Grouping](https://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)__- Data can be grouped by different time periods (days, months), categories (product types, store locations), etc.

- __[Filtering and Sorting](https://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)__- Pivot tables allow for filtering and sorting data to focus on specific aspects of the dataset.

### 2.Formulas:

  - __[SUMIF/SUMIFS](https://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)__- To sum values based on one or more criteria.

  - __[COUNTIF/COUNTIFS](https://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)__- To count the number of cells that meet one or more criteria.

  - __[AVERAGEIF/AVERAGEIFS](https://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)__- To calculate the average of cells that meet one or more criteria.

  - __[VLOOKUP/HLOOKUP](https://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)__ - For looking up data in a table based on a key value.

  - __[IF](https://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)__ - For conditional operations, returning different values based on logical tests.

### 3.Charts and Graphs:

   - __[Bar and Column Charts](https://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)__ - To compare data across different categories.

   - __[Line Charts](https://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)__ - To show trends over time.

   - __[Pie Charts](https://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)__ - To show proportions of a whole.

   - __[Pivot Charts](https://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)__ - Charts linked to pivot tables for dynamic data visualization.

 ### 4.Conditional Formatting:

   - __[Highlighting Cells](https://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)__ - To visually differentiate data based on values, such as highlighting high sales numbers.

   - __[Data Bars](https://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)__ - To add bars inside cells to represent the value relative to others.

 ### 5.Data Validation:

   Ensuring data integrity by setting rules for what data can be entered in cells (e.g., date ranges, specific values).

 ### 6.Slicers:
 
   Visual filters added to pivot tables and pivot charts for easier data exploration.
