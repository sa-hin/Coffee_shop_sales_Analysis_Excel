   - __[Data Bars](https://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)__ - To add bars inside cells to represent the value relative to others.

 ### 5.Data Validation:

   Ensuring data integrity by setting rules for what data can be entered in cells (e.g., date ranges, specific values).

 ### 6.Slicers:
 
   Visual filters added to pivot tables and pivot charts for easier data exploration.
