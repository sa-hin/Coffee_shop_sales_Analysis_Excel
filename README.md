## Functions and Features in Excel

### Pivot Tables:

__Data Summarization__: Pivot tables summarize data by aggregating totals, averages, counts, and other statistics.

__Grouping__: Data can be grouped by different time periods (days, months), categories (product types, store locations), etc.

__Filtering and Sorting__: Pivot tables allow for filtering and sorting data to focus on specific aspects of the dataset.

### Formulas:

__SUMIF/SUMIFS__: To sum values based on one or more criteria.

__COUNTIF/COUNTIFS__: To count the number of cells that meet one or more criteria.

__AVERAGEIF/AVERAGEIFS__: To calculate the average of cells that meet one or more criteria.

__VLOOKUP/HLOOKUP__: For looking up data in a table based on a key value.

__IF__: For conditional operations, returning different values based on logical tests.

#### Charts and Graphs:

__Bar and Column Charts__: To compare data across different categories.

__Line Charts__: To show trends over time.

__Pie Charts__: To show proportions of a whole.

__Pivot Charts__: Charts linked to pivot tables for dynamic data visualization.

### Conditional Formatting:

__Highlighting Cells__: To visually differentiate data based on values, such as highlighting high sales numbers.

__Data Bars__: To add bars inside cells to represent the value relative to others.

### Data Validation:

Ensuring data integrity by setting rules for what data can be entered in cells (e.g., date ranges, specific values).

### Slicers:

Visual filters added to pivot tables and pivot charts for easier data exploration.
